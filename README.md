# Dynamical system metrics

The original code is matlab code, which is coded by Faranda.<br> 
A python code is still given.<br>
<br>
This package contains code to estimate the local dimension, persistence and co-recurrence of dynamical systems from time series. It contains two main scripts and three
auxiliary functions.<br>

Main scripts:<br>

-Main_Univariate_Analysis_Example.m : It includes the computation of the local dimension and persistence for the Lorenz 1963 attractor in the univariate case.<br> 

-Main_Bivariate_Analysis_Example.m : It includes the computation of the local dimension, the persistence and the co-recurrence coefficient for two random fields in the<br>
bivariate case.<br>


Auxiliary functions:<br>

-fun_dynsys_univariate_analysis.m : Computation of local dimensions and persistence for each point along a trajectory x, for a given quantile.<br>

-fun_dynsys_bivariate_analysis.m : Computation of local dimensions, persistence, co-dimensions, co-persistence, co-recurrences for each point along a trajectory x, a given quantile.<br> 
<br>

-fun_extremal_index_sueveges : This function computes the extremal index for a time series.<br>
